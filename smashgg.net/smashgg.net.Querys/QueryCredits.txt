Most of the querys used in smashgg.net are from smashgg.js and smashgg.py both are written by BrandonCookeDev.

All credits for these scripts go to him.

Other querys may be taken from examples out of the smash.gg developer portal.

All querys are properly credited in the source.
A compiled list of querys will be made for a future repository.
